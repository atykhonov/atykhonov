### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned software engineer with over 15 years of hands-on
experience in the dynamic realm of software development. My diverse
background spans outsourcing, product development, and IT consulting,
encompassing both greenfield projects featuring cutting-edge
technologies and legacy systems requiring meticulous maintenance.

Over the past three years, I have excelled in remote work
environments, showcasing exceptional communication and self-management
skills. My programming journey has been anchored by Python, my
preferred language, although I am equally adept at working with
JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and more. With expertise extending to the
full-stack, I have crafted web solutions from frontend to backend, and
my proficiency extends to DevOps practices, including Linux and
Docker.
